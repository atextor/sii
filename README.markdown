Sii (Studying in Ireland)
=========================

Sii is an arcade/old-style-RPG-esque game written in Scala.

Building
--------

You need Apache Ant to build.
Ant targets:
	
	ant compile     - To compile the program
	ant jar         - To create an executable jar file
	ant exe         - To create a self-contained Windows .exe file
	ant run         - To run the compiled game
	ant clean       - Delete all built files

The build process makes use of Proguard (to create a one-in-all
jar file) and Launch4j to create a Windows .exe.
